    "[LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) make it possible to embed intelligence into a new class of applications. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a framework to help build applications with LLMs. Here, we will overview the basics of LangGraph, explain its benefits, show how to use it to build workflows / agents, and show how it works with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) / [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).\n",

    "[Chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) are the foundation of LLM applications. They are typically accessed through a chat interface that takes a list of [messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as input and returns a [message](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as output. LangChain provides [a standardized interface for chat models](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html), making it easy to [access many different providers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)."
